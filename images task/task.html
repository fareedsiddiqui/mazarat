<b><i>ABOUT:</i></b>
<hr />
Abdullah Shah Ghazi (Arabic: عبد الله شاه غازي‎) (c. 720) was an eighth-century Muslim mystic and Sufi whose shrine is located in the Clifton an affluent seaside municipality in Karachi, Pakistan.[1] His real name was Abdullah al-Ashtar.

<b><i>MARTYRDOM:</i></b>
<hr />
Inside the shrine of the Abdullah Shah Ghazi
Around the year 761 AD, Muhammad Nafs al-Zakiyah and his brother Ibrahim sailed from Aden to Sind where they consulted with the governor, Umar ibn Hafs Hazarmard before returning to Kufah and Medina. His son Abdullah al-Ashtar, also known as Abdullah Shah Ghazi, married a woman from Sindh and had children by her. However, Umar received word from his wife in Basrah that Muhammad Nafs Al-Zakiyah had been killed in Medina (14 Ramadan 145/6 December 762). In consequence, Umar felt that their presence in the capital compromised his position as governor. Unwilling to take any definite action either for or against them, he summoned Abdullah al-Ashtar and suggested:

"I have an idea: one of the princes of Sindh has a mighty kingdom with numerous supporters. Despite his polytheism, he greatly honors [the family of] the Prophet. He is a reliable man. I will write him and conclude an agreement between the two of you. You can then go to him, stay there, and you will not desire anything better"[2].

Abdullah al-Ashtar went to that area spent Some years there, probably from 762 AD to 769 AD. Eventually hearing of their presence in Sindh, the caliph al-Mansur replaced Umar ibn Hafs with Hisham ibn Amr al-Taghlibi on the understanding that he seize Abdullah al-Ashtar, and annex the non-Muslim region. When Hisham, after reaching Sind, also proved loath to undertake the task, his brother Sufayh (later a governor of Sindh) did it for him, killing Abdullah along with many of his companions.[3]</blockquote></blockquote></p>

Sakhi Sultan Manghopir's proper name is Hasan and according to another version Kamaluddin. He was titled a pir by Baba Farid, whose disciple he became. Pir Mangho Urs is celebrated in the Islamic month of Zil Hijjah.

Originally, he was an Arab and a descendant of Ali ibn Abi Talib. He is a Hassani (descendants of Hasan ibn Ali) from the mother's side and Husaini (descendant of Hussain ibn Ali from father's side. He came to India from Hijaz in the 13th century AD. That was the time of the Tartar's invasion of Muslim lands which created great havoc. He participated in the jihad against them. Then he performed the Hajj, and while he was in Medina, he had a vision of Muhammad who directed him to go to Ajudhan (present day Pak Patan) and meet Fariduddin Ganjshakar[clarification needed]. He then went, to Ajudhan and presented himself to Sheikh Ganj Shakher. In 662 AH (1263 or 1264 AD) he was admitted as a disciple in the Chistiah order, and he became the 40th Khalifah/Caliph of Baba Farid Ganjshakar. Based on the advice of Baba Farid Saheb he went to Multan in 659 AH (1260 or 1261 AD). From there he travelled to various places in the pursuit of spiritual attainment and then settled down in Manghopir where he carried out his missionary work.<br /><br />
<b><i>Crocodiles:</i></b>
<hr />
The crocodiles are an integral part of the shrine and are so tightly interwoven with the story of the saint that it is almost impossible to judge between fact & fiction. There are many traditions about myth of crocodiles, as if it is believed that Baba Farid gave the reptiles to Manghopir. According to scientific explanations, these crocodiles were carried through some heavy floods, during ancient times and later gathered or collected at this pond. Archaeological investigations have also suggested the existence of a Bronze Age settlement (2500-1700 BC) near Manghopir, who worshipped crocodiles and before the advent of Islam crocodiles were also thought sacred for Hindus.

<b><i>ABOUT:</i></b>
<hr />
often referred to as Barī Imām or Barī Sarkār (1617–1705), was a 17th-century Sufi ascetic from Punjab who was the most prominent Sufi of the Qadiriyya order. He is venerated as the patron saint of Islamabad, Pakistan. Born in Karsal to a family descended from Muhammad through the linage of Imam Musa Al Kazim, the life of Bari Imam is known "essentially through oral tradition and hagiographical booklets and celebrated in numerous songs" of Indian and Pakistani Sufism.[2] In the present day, Bari Imam is one of the most popular and widely venerated saints of Punjab.[2]
<br /><br />
<b><i>Biography:</i></b>
<hr />
Bari Imam was eight years old when his family migrated from Karsal in Chakwal District to what is now Aabpara, Islamabad in Pakistan. According to some sources, he later married and had one daughter, though both women are said to have died prematurely.[2] After their passing, Bari Imam began wandering the forests of the Hazara district in Northern Punjab, where he spent twenty-four years as an ascetic.[2]

Because Bari Imam Sarkar did not transmit any of his doctrines to writing; as such, it may be rightly presumed that he bequeathed all of his teachings orally.[3] Bari Imam went to Ghorghushti in Campbellpur (now known as Attock) where he stayed for two years to learning fiqh, hadith, logic, and other disciplines related to Islam, because at that time Ghorghushti was a great seat of Islamic learning.

Bari Imam was renowned in his own life for being an ascetic who subjected himself to great self-humiliation in the public sphere, "living among the pariahs and consciously exposing himself to the disdain of the people."[2][4]

A celebrated miracle worker, Bari Imam is also described in regional lore as one through whom God performed many marvels to convince the local people of the truth of Islam; thus, some of the most popular miracles ascribed to him are his having caused water to gush forth from rocks and his having brought back to life the dead buffaloes of a peasant who had earlier provided the saint with milk during his ten years of spiritual seclusion.[2]

<b><i>ABOUT:</i></b>
<hr />
Abu ’l-Ḥasan ʿAlī b. ʿUthmān b. ʿAlī al-Ghaznawī al-Jullābī al-Hujwīrī (c. 1009-1072/77), known as ʿAlī al-Hujwīrī or al-Hujwīrī (also spelt Hajweri, Hajveri, or Hajvery) for short, or reverentially as Shaykh Syed ʿAlī al-Hujwīrī or as Dātā Ganj Bakhsh by Muslims of the Indian subcontinent, was an 11th-century Iranian Sunni Muslim[4] mystic, theologian, and preacher from Ghazna, who became famous for composing the Kashf al-maḥjūb (Unveiling of the Hidden), which is considered the "earliest formal treatise" on Sufism in Persian.[5] Ali Hujwiri is believed to have contributed "significantly" to the spread of Islam in South Asia through his preaching,[6] with one historian describing him as "one of the most important figures to have spread Islam in the Indian subcontinent."[7]

In the present day, Ali Hujwiri is venerated as the patron saint of Lahore, Pakistan by the traditional Sunni Muslims of the area.[8][9] He is, moreover, one of the most widely venerated saints in the entire Indian subcontinent,[10] and his tomb-shrine in Lahore, popularly known as Data Darbar, is one of the most frequented shrines in South Asia.[11] At present, it is Pakistan's largest shrine "in numbers of annual visitors and in the size of the shrine complex,"[12] and, having been nationalized in 1960, is managed today by the Department of Awqaf and Religious Affairs of the Punjab.[13] The mystic himself, remains a "household name" in the daily Islam of both India and Pakistan.[14] In 2016, the Government of Pakistan declared 21 November to be a public holiday for the commemoration of the commencement of Ali Hujwiri's three-day death anniversary.[15]

Main article: Kashf ul Mahjoob
Ali Hujwiri is perhaps most famous for writing what has been described as "the earliest formal treatise on Ṣūfism in Persian,"[61] the renowned Kashf al-maḥjūb (Unveiling of the Hidden).[62] The work presents itself as an introduction to the various aspects of orthodox Sufism, and also provides biographies of the greatest saints of the Islamic community.[63] The Kashf al-maḥjūb is the only work of Ali Hujwiri that has remained until today.[64]

<b><i>ABOUT:</i></b>
<hr />
Bibi Pāk Daman (Urdu: بی بی پاکدامن) is the mausoleum of Ruqayyah bint Ali located in Lahore, Punjab, Pakistan.[1] Legend has it that it holds the graves of six ladies from Muhammad's household (Ahl Al-Bayt). Ruqayyah bint Ali ibn Abu Talib was the daughter of Muhammad's cousin and son-in-law Ali ibn Abu Talib with his wife Sahba' bint Rabi'a al-Taghlibiyya.[2] Ruqayah bint Ali was the Half sister of Al-Abbas ibn Ali and also the wife of Muslim ibn Aqeel[3] (emissary of third Shi'a Imam Husayn ibn Ali to Kufah). Others are said to be Muslim ibn Aqil's sister and daughters. It is said that these ladies came here after the event of the battle of Karbala on the 10th day of the month of Muharram in 61 AH (October 10, AD 680). Bibi Pak Daman, which means the "chaste lady", is the collective name of the six ladies believed to interred at this mausoleum, though it is also (mistakenly) popularly used to refer to the personage of Ruqayyah bint Ali alone.[4] They were among the women who brought Islam to South Asia, preaching and engaging in missionary activity in the environs of Lahore. It is said that Data Ganj Bakhsh, considered a great Sufi saint of the South Asia, was himself a devotee of the Bibi Pak Daman shrine[4] and received holy knowledge from this auspicious shrine.

Some scholars consider Ruqayah to have been the daughter of Sayid Ahmed Tokhta (12th century). Bibi Paak Daaman is located between Garhi Shahu and Railway Station area. The easiest way to go to Bibi Paak Daaman is from the Empress Road and from there, take the small road opposite Police Lines and then the first left-turn. Recently Government of Pakistan is considering approval of the expansion of the Bibi Pak Daman's shrine.
